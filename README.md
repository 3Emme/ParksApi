#### By _**Emme Buentiempo**_

## Description

This application was created as an Epicodus assignment, with the intent to have it serve as a demonstration of knowledge after the program's 13th week. For the time being this README will serve as a checklist to demonstrate the satisfaction of all project requirements and objectives. 

## Project requirements:

For your final C#/.NET code review, youâ€™ll build one of the three APIs below:

Parks Lookup: Create an API for state and national parks. The API will list state and national parks.
You have the freedom to build out your APIs as you wish. At the very least, your API should include the following:

  * Full CRUD functionality. [Incomplete]
  * Further exploration of one of the following objectives: authentication, versioning, pagination, Swagger documentation, or CORS. [Incomplete]
  * Complete documentation of API endpoints and the further exploration you did. [Incomplete]

## Project Objectives:

  * Application includes CRUD functionality and successfully returns responses to API calls. [Incomplete]
  * Application includes at least one of the further exploration objectives: authentication, versioning, pagination, Swagger documentation, or CORS. [Incomplete]
  * Application is well-documented, including specific documentation on further exploration. [Incomplete]
  * Commit history clearly shows eight hours of work. [Incomplete]
